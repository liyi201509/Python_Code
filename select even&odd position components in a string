#Write a function called "num_changer" that accepts a string 
#of digits (0-9). You should make an integer from the digits 
#of the even indices and another number from the digits in 
#the odd indices. Return the sum of these two numbers. You 
#can assume the given string will have a length of at least 
#2 digits.
#
#For example, if the string was "123456", you would split
#this into two integers, 135 and 246. Adding them would give
#381. Or if the string was "1357", you would split this into
#15 and 37, then add them to get 52.
#
#Do not use any loops for your solution. Instead of using
#loops, you can use an extra bit of string slicing syntax.
#If you include second colon in a string slice, the number
#that follows it lets you skip characters in the string. For
#example:

def num_changer(string):
    num=len(string)
    divide=int(num/2)
    
    a=string[0:num:2]
    b=string[1:num:2]
    #print(a,b)
    sum=int(a)+int(b)
    return(sum)
    

stringInt = "123456"
result = num_changer(stringInt)
print(stringInt + " -> " + str(result))
