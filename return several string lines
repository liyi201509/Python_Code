#function called "steps" that should accept as input
#a number between 1 and 9. It should then return output such
#as the following:
#
#steps(3)
#1111
#	2222
#		3333
#
#Specifically, it should start with 1, and show four of each
#number from 1 to the inputted value, each on a separate
#line. The first line should have no tabs in front, but each
#subsequent line should have one more tab than the line
#before it. You may assume that we will not call steps() with
#a value greater than 9.
